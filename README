This repository contains some simple scripts for use with the Xen
hypervisor.  The cz-xen and cz-xen-backup scripts are crafted to
integrate well using remctl.  The scripts are normally deployed
as a Debian package.

Script cz-xen

  This script manages xen guests.  Guests can be created, destroyed,
  deleted, and booted.  Additionally the script supports searching
  across multiple xen servers to find a guest using remctl.

Script cz-xen-backup

  This script backs up xen guests.  The script supports backing up
  to shared storage that requires Kerberos authentication and/or
  AFS tokens.  The script will copy a machine from one xen host to
  another and boot the guest when the migration is complete.

Script cz-console

  A trivial script to access a guest's console.
